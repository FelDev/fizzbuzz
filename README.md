**"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."**

("Have you ever been asked to solve the FizzBuzz challenge in an interview?" was a question in the 2019 Stack Overflow developer survey.
I had not, but was much intrigued.)
